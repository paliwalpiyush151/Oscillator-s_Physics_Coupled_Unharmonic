# Mini Project - Coupled Anharmonic Oscillators: Damped and Forced

- In this team mini project, we have studied different oscillatory systems found in nature and simulated its behaviour with its oscillatory equations keeping in mind damping coefficient and other factors.   
- 4th order Runga Kutta method is used to study physics of the different coupled systems.
